Factorial Designs in Statistics

This document provides an overview and code examples of factorial designs and analyses in statistics. Specifically, it covers:

Factorial Logistic Regression
Definition and use cases
Encoding categorical variables for logistic regression
Fitting factorial logistic regression models in Python
Hypothesis testing for specific contrasts
Testing interaction effects
Factorial ANOVA
Definition and use cases
Fitting factorial ANOVA models in Python
Interpreting ANOVA table output
Conducting post hoc analysis (Tukey's test)
Additional example with 'write', 'female' and 'ses' variables
The document aims to demonstrate the implementation of factorial designs to analyze the combined effects of multiple categorical independent variables on a dependent variable. Code examples use Python libraries like statsmodels and scikit-learn to fit the models, test hypotheses and interactions, and compare means across groups.

The content serves an educational purpose to explain these statistical techniques for experiments with two or more factors. Readers can use the document to learn applications, interpretation, and Python coding for factorial logistic regression and ANOVA.
